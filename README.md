# Algorithms

A collection of algorithms.

More Specifically:

  Prime Numbers:
  - Testing if a number is prime
  - Getting the next higher prime number
  - Prime Factorization
  - Creating a list of prime numbers from 1 to n
  
  Recursive Binary Search
  
  Bitwise Operations:
  - And, Or, Xor, Left shift, Right shift
  
  Matrix Math
  
  Comparing N Lists with n items each
  - For example, with lists A, B, and C, this algorithm 
  - compares (AB), (AC), and (BC), and so on for N lists
  
  Determining if a list of elements has duplicates or not
  
  Set Operations and Algorithms:
    
   Algorithms:
     - Searching a list for duplicates 
     - Getting a list of duplicates 
     - Removing duplicates from a list
     - Combining two arrays 
     - Array contains method
   
   Set Operations:
     - Union operation 
     - Intersection operation 
     - Power set operation
     - Subset operation
     - Strict subset operation
     - Difference operation
